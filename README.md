# directory_cleaner
If you're a web-developer then you have a folder full of files that you're afraid to delete because something might break. This directory-cleaner makes a new folder for all your files being used in a source code.

To use this, download the code, and run it in a GCC compiler. Download the code in your folder where all your files/folders are located. It can be used for c++ 14 and up. Enter the path of your index file. Enter the new folder location when prompted.
