# Directory Cleaner
If you're a web-developer then you have a folder full of files that you're afraid to delete because something might break. This directory-cleaner makes a new folder for all your files that are being used in your source code.

To use this script, download it, and run it in a GCC compiler.  It can be used for c++ 14 and up. Download the script in your folder where all your files/folders related to the index are located. Enter the relative path of the index file. Enter the new folder location when prompted.
