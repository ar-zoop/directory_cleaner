<h2>3 New Dangerous Trends Why Many Smart Students Fail</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Social Media is Reducing Concentration</li>
	<li>Competition is Getting Harder</li>
	<li>Coaching Alone Is Not Enough for Success</li>
</ol>
<h3><span style="color:#999999;font-weight:400">Dangerous Trend #1</span>
	<br>Social Media is Reducing Concentration</h3>
<p>Now social media and smartphones are reducing our concentration, which makes it so much harder to study for most students.</p>
<p>Those who can concentrate have a huge advantage in competitive exams.</p>

<h3><span style="color:#999999;font-weight:400">Dangerous Trend #2</span>
	<br>Competition is Getting Harder</h3>
	
<p style="text-align:center"><img class="img-thumbnail" src="images/bold-prediction.jpg"></p>
<p>In most tough competitive exams, out of every 10,000 who appear in the exams, only 20 to 200 get
	success.</p>
<p>In other words, out of every 100,000, as many as 99,000 to 99,800 fail in the competitive exams in India.</p>

<h3><span style="color:#999999;font-weight:400">Dangerous Trend #3</span>
	<br>Coaching Alone Is Not Enough for Success</h3>
	<p>As shown above, less than 1 percent of aspirants get success in many of the tough competitive exams in India, though as many as half the students might join coaching. What it means is that over 90% of students who join coaching fail.</p>
